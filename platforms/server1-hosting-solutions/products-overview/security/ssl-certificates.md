### What is SSL?

SSL (more precisely TLS) encrypts the connection between a visitor’s browser and your server so data travels securely.

* Creates a **secure, encrypted** session between browser and server
* Protects **logins, payments, and personal data**
* Shows **HTTPS + padlock** in the address bar
* **Authenticates** your domain (DV) and, with OV/EV, your **organization identity** for added trust

> DV certificates are the fastest to issue. OV and EV add verified company identity details for stronger user confidence.

***

### Why add SSL now?

* **Encrypt sensitive data** end-to-end
* **Protect user privacy** and prevent tampering
* **Secure transactions** and forms
* **Prove site legitimacy** (OV/EV)
* **Activate HTTPS** and the padlock
* **Improve SEO** — Google favors secure sites
* **Avoid “Not secure” warnings** in Chrome/Firefox for HTTP pages

***

### Zero-touch renewals (where supported)

With our SSL services\*, you won’t have to manually reissue every year. Before expiry, we create a renewal order. After payment, we automatically validate and deploy the new cert.

\* Your domain must be hosted with the same provider that sold the SSL, and the server must run **cPanel, Plesk, or DirectAdmin**.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What is an SSL Certificate?**\
A digital certificate that enables HTTPS encryption and browser trust for your domain (and, with OV/EV, your organization).

**Do I really need SSL?**\
Yes. Browsers mark HTTP sites as “Not secure,” and search engines reward HTTPS. SSL protects users and your brand.

**DV vs OV vs EV — what’s different?**\
DV → domain control only (fast). OV/EV → adds verified business identity details for higher trust and conversion.

**What is a Wildcard SSL?**\
A single certificate that secures your domain and **all first-level subdomains** (e.g., `*.example.com`).

**Advantages of EV?**\
Highest industry authentication; stronger anti-phishing signal and enterprise-grade assurance for payments and signups.
