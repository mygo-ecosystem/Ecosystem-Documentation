### What you get

* **Incoming Spam & Malware Filtering**\
  Multi-layer filtering (RBL/heuristics/ML/sandbox) blocks spam, phishing, ransomware, malware, spoofing, and BEC attempts **before** they hit your server.
* **Outgoing Filtering (IP/Domain Reputation Control)**\
  Stops compromised accounts from sending spam; protects your IP/domain reputation and prevents blacklisting.
* **Email Continuity (Spooling + Webmail)**\
  If your mail server is down, mail queues safely and users can **send/receive via continuity webmail**. No lost messages.
* **Quarantine & Self-Service**\
  User/administrator quarantine portals, digest emails, one-click release/allow/deny, multi-tenant roles, SSO/LDAP ready.
* **Archiving & eDiscovery (Optional)**\
  Tamper-resistant retention with journaling, searchable archive, legal hold, export, and compliance policies.
* **Reporting & Insights**\
  Real-time dashboards, domain and mailbox stats, top senders/recipients, threat categories, and forensic logs.
* **Any Mail Platform**\
  Works with Plesk/cPanel/DirectAdmin, Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Zimbra, Kerio, and custom SMTP stacks.
