# Website Security

## Website Security — Malware Protection & WAF

All SERVER1 hosting services come **protected by Imunify360** at the server level. You get always-on malware detection, proactive defense, smart WAF rules, reputation/blacklist checks, and automatic quarantine — all working quietly in the background.

### What’s included by default (with SERVER1 hosting)

* **Imunify360 protection**: real-time malware detection & cleanup
* **Proactive defense** and herd-immunity rules
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF) ruleset**
* **Reputation/blacklist monitoring**
* **Brute-force & bot mitigation**
* **Auto-quarantine** of infected files
* **24/7 security monitoring** from our NOC

> No action needed: security is pre-enabled on our hosting platforms (cPanel, Plesk supported).

***

### Optional, add more protection (on request)

If you want extra, website-level coverage and a visible trust indicator, we can activate a **SiteLock** bundle for your domain (no pricing shown here):

* **Daily website malware scans** (pages & files)
* **Automatic malware removal**
* **App vulnerability scans** (plugins/themes/CVEs)
* **OWASP Top 10 mitigation**
* **Dedicated WAF**
* **SiteLock™ Trust Seal** for higher user confidence

***

### Why this matters

* **Stop hacks early** with continuous detection
* **Protect user data & privacy** with layered defense
* **Prevent blacklisting** and reputation damage
* **Harden apps** against common exploits (SQLi, XSS, etc.)
* **Keep sites fast** with smart filtering and optional CDN

***

### If your site is already hacked

We provide **emergency clean-up** on request: rapid triage, complete malware removal (manual if needed), priority handling, and short-term aftercare monitoring — no pricing listed here.

***

### Works with your stack

* **CMS:** WordPress, WooCommerce, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, headless frameworks
* **Panels:** cPanel, Plesk, DirectAdmin
* **Hosting:** Shared, Reseller, VPS, Dedicated (all SERVER1 tiers)

**Bottom line:** Your website on SERVER1 is **protected by default** with **Imunify360**. Need extra assurance (site-level WAF/CDN and trust seal)? Ask us to enable a **SiteLock** bundle for your domain.
