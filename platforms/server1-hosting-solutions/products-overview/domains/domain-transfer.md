# Domain Transfer

## Overview

Move your domains to SERVER1 and manage everything in one place. Our platform automates the entire flow - from EPP code capture and status checks to transfer approval and nameserver updates — so you stay online with zero stress.

### Why transfer to SERVER1

* **Single dashboard** for domains, DNS, hosting, SSL, and email
* **Automated transfers** (EPP capture, lock checks, approval handling)
* **Auto-renew & reminders** to prevent accidental expiry
* **DNS & nameserver control** (keep current NS or switch to ours)
* **WHOIS privacy** (where supported)
* **24/7 support** for transfer issues and DNS changes

***

### How a domain transfer works (gTLDs like .com/.net/.org)

1. **Unlock** the domain at your current registrar.
2. **Get the EPP/Auth code** (transfer key).
3. **Temporarily disable WHOIS privacy** so approval emails reach you.
4. **Confirm the admin contact email**.
5. **Start the transfer** in your SERVER1 account and submit the EPP code.
6. **Choose nameservers** (keep existing or switch to SERVER1).
7. **Wait for completion** — typically **5–7 days** unless the losing registrar approves sooner.

> Most gTLD transfers **add one year** to the domain’s term (registry policy). Exact rules are shown during checkout.

### Automation you benefit from

* **Real-time status tracking** (Pending, ClientTransferProhibited, Approved, Completed)
* **Post-transfer sync** of WHOIS/expiry and auto-renew settings
* **Bulk transfer tools** for importing many domains with EPPs
* **Email/SMS notifications** when action is required

***

### Requirements & common blockers

* **60-day lock:** Newly registered or recently transferred domains are often locked for 60 days (ICANN).
* **ClientTransferProhibited:** Remove the transfer lock before starting.
* **Accurate contact email:** The admin/contact must receive approval messages.
* **WHOIS privacy:** Disable during transfer if it masks your email.
* **Registry/ccTLD specifics:** Some extensions have their own rules (see below).

***

### ccTLD notes (quick reference)

* **.UK / .CO.UK:** May require an **IPS tag** change at the current registrar.
* **.EU:** Registrant must be in EU/EEA/UK; transfers are often instant after code validation.
* **.CA:** **CIRA** Canadian Presence Requirements.
* **.US:** **US Nexus** requirement.
* **.AU (.com.au/.net.au):** Registrant **ABN/ACN** eligibility; email verification required.
* **.FR, .DE, .NL:** Local contact/data format rules; some need explicit registry confirmation.

_We surface any registry-specific prompts during checkout so you know exactly what’s needed._

### DNS & uptime during transfer

* **No downtime:** Transfers don’t move DNS by themselves. If you keep current nameservers, your site and email stay online.
* **Switching to SERVER1 DNS?** We can pre-create your DNS zone so you can cut over with **zero downtime**.
* **Email safety:** If you’re changing MX records, schedule a low-traffic window; we’ll guide you.

***

### After completion

* **Term extended** (where applicable) and **expiry synced** into your SERVER1 account
* **WHOIS privacy** can be re-enabled (if supported)
* **Auto-renew** available with advance reminders
* **DNS management** and nameserver changes in your dashboard

***

### Bulk transfers (agencies & teams)

* Import a list (domain,EPP) — the system queues jobs, monitors statuses, and flags exceptions
* Optionally **freeze DNS** changes until all domains complete, then switch nameservers in one go

### FAQs

**How long does it take?**\
Most gTLDs complete in **5–7 days** unless the losing registrar fast-approves.

**Will my website/email go down?**\
No, not if you keep existing nameservers. If you switch DNS, we stage records to avoid interruptions.

**Do I get an extra year?**\
For most gTLDs, yes. Some ccTLDs differ; we show exact rules before payment.

**Can you help with EPP codes and unlocking?**\
Yes — we provide registrar-specific steps and check lock/WHOIS/privacy status with you.

**Can I transfer close to expiry?**\
Yes, but avoid last-minute submissions to prevent lapses.
